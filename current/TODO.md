# What to do?
1. If it became a possibility please try to PUBLISH the code as a PAPER.
2. Add L1 + L2 = L accuracy check as in DFPOT.
3. Add Coulomb potential calculation with charge distributions.
   1. Add Coulomb barrier finding option?
4. Add multipole expansions/terms for U_DF[L,M]?
5. Add Clebsch-Gordon coefficients.
6. Add charge distribution to matter distribution transforming.
7. Documentation. 
8. Add density dependent interactions **_[70% is done! WORK IN PROGRESS]_**.
9. <s>Change the code name to BiFold/BiFOLD or BFold?</s>
10. <s>Print volume integrals and such necessary information in a clean way!</s>
11. <s> Add print out in Fresco format named as "fort.4" file.</s>
12. <s>Add examples.</s>
13. <s>Transform the code a Python library if it is plausible?</s>
14. <s>Create a file with predefined values for nn interactions such as M3Y-Reid/Paris etc.</s>
15. <s>Add usage of pre-calculated densities/interactions (using interpolation).</s>
16. <s>Add potential summation feature:
    1. U_DF = U_DF1 + UDF2 + ...
    2. U = U_any + U_DF</s>


# What to check to clear the code?
1. Check all the given text information: 
   1. are they make sense or not? 
   2. are their grammar correct or not? 
2. clear any unnecessary and unused: library, command, methods etc.

# Future of the code...
1. If it is possible use analytical fourier transforms of the functions by default,
give an option to change to numerical ones.
2. <s>Add finite range knock-on exchange interactions.</s>
3. Add deformed folding potentials.
4. Add elastic scattering calculations?
5. Add alpha decay calculations?
6. JLM interaction?
7. Create Python env for a self-sufficient code.
