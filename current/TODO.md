# What to do?
1. If it became a possibility please try to PUBLISH the code as a PAPER.
2. Print volume integrals and such necessary information in a clean way!
3. Change the code name to BiFold/BiFOLD or BFold?
4. Add density dependent interactions **_[70% is done! WORK IN PROGRESS]_**.
5. Add L1 + L2 = L accuracy check as in DFPOT.
6. Add Coulomb potential calculation with charge distributions.
   1. Add Coulomb barrier finding option?
7. Add multipole expansions/terms for U_DF[L,M]?
8. Add Clebsch-Gordon coefficients.
9. Add charge distribution to matter distribution transforming.
10. Add print out in Fresco format named as "fort.4" file.
11. Add examples.
12. Documentation.
13. <s>Transform the code a Python library if it is plausible?</s>
14. <s>Create a file with predefined values for nn interactions such as M3Y-Reid/Paris etc.</s>
15. <s>Add usage of pre-calculated densities/interactions (using interpolation).</s>
16. <s>Add potential summation feature:
    1. U_DF = U_DF1 + UDF2 + ...
    2. U = U_any + U_DF</s>


# What to check to clear the code?
1. Check all the given text information: 
   1. are they make sense or not? 
   2. are their grammar correct or not? 
2. clear any unnecessary and unused: library, command, methods etc.

# Future of the code...
1. If it is possible use analytical fourier transforms of the functions by default,
give an option to change to numerical ones.
2. Add finite range knock-on exchange interactions.
3. Add deformed folding potentials.
4. Add elastic scattering calculations?
5. Add alpha decay calculations?
6. JLM interaction?
7. Create Python env for a self-sufficient code.
